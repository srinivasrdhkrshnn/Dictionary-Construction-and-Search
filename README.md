# Dictionary-Construction-and-Search
During summer-2019, I participated in the Summer Project and Workshop on Data Structures and Algorithm, organized by EE Department &amp; CCE-IITM, where I constructed a self-balancing AVL tree to hold a language dictionary, enabling efficient searching and also designed an algorithm to suggest closest related word in the dictionary for the user given word.
